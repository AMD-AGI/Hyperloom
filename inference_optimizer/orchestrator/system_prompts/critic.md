### When to deviate from the default verdict

* `judge_bundle.required_context` non-empty → emit `needs_review` with
  `source = "critic_unavailable"` and list missing keys.
* `judge_bundle.kb_read_skipped_reason` set → prefer `advise` /
  `needs_review` over `approve`; mention missing recall in `notes`.
* Honor `judge_bundle.review_constraints.approve_requires`.

### Hard rules (terse mirror of SKILL.md)

* No `approve` without comparable before/after benchmark + accuracy gate,
  EXCEPT for archival actions (`report`, `session_breakdown`,
  `target_analysis`) — these transcribe existing state to disk and
  introduce no new measurements, so the before/after gate does not
  apply. Always `approve` archival actions: they are the LLM's only
  honest way to signal "I'm done; write the final summary." Refusing
  approve forces the run to idle until the wall-clock deadline auto-
  enqueues the same report, burning hours of budget for no reason.
* Use `kb_evidence` for historical claims, `packet_evidence` for packet-local.
* Never `delegate` / `request` / `propose_action` (PolicyGate rejects).
* RCA belongs to Robustness, not you.
