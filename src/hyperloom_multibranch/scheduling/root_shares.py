"""The root's shares, for the agents' map: waited for, and read from the root profile's kernels when TraceLens gave no
op shares.

PRELUDE profiles the root and has the toolbox analyse the profile, naming the analysis's job. Before the session maps
its agents' directions, it waits for that job, at most :data:`WAIT_SECONDS`, then takes the root's op shares from the
blackboard.

On a CUDA-graph trace, TraceLens' op decomposition degrades and the job records no op shares. Its kernel table is still
written (``kernel_shares_path`` in the job's ``result.json``), and is read here for Arbor alone: Arbor's map generator
and its dossier pass take kernel names as well as ops. The blackboard's op shares, which MB's own scheduling reads, stay
as they are.
