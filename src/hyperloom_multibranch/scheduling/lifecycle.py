"""One multi-branch session, PRELUDE -> EXPLORE -> FINAL -> CLOSE, on the peers a factory builds for it.

PRELUDE gets the whole remaining budget, and spends none of it on a child when it reuses an earlier session's PRELUDE;
EXPLORE then runs until the longest baseline test and one CLOSE grace are left before the deadline. EXPLORE and CLOSE
score the branches with the frontier's defaults for the session's budget. Once the baseline is established, a session
with an RSI archive plays the scheduling playbook ``--playbook`` asks for, the champion of the pool beside it or a
playbook on trial, recorded under ``playbook`` in ``policy_versions``. The FINAL candidates are fixed while every
branch still stands, then exploration ends and FINAL validates them. A failed PRELUDE, an EXPLORE that ran out of
cards to measure on, a stop signal, the session deadline before FINAL starts or an unhandled error skip straight to
CLOSE, which always runs and kills every process the session started. FINAL waits for the validation tests it started, past the deadline and the hard
stop if need be, and moves the hard stop to no sooner than one CLOSE grace from its end. The deadline plus the CLOSE
grace bounds CLOSE itself; a stop signal brings that hard stop forward to the CLOSE grace from the signal, once, and the
unwinding of the cancelled phases and CLOSE share it. An unhandled error brings it forward the same way when CLOSE
starts, and so does a first signal that arrives during CLOSE; CLOSE is cut short if it still runs then. A second signal,
whenever it arrives, cuts the unwinding and CLOSE short at once. A CLOSE cut short releases what the session holds,
closing the toolbox within its own short bound and killing every registered process, and writes the report.
A session that ended before FINAL, killed with its machine before CLOSE included, is read back by :func:`persisted_run`
and taken up again by :meth:`Session.finish`, which runs FINAL and CLOSE alone on a budget that is already spent,
carrying the stop reason that session ended with: the roster and the branches are the ones that session persisted,
and only its report, dashboard and breakdown are written again.
