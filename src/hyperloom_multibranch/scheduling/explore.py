"""EXPLORE: open the opening batch, then let the judge steer the branches until the EXPLORE deadline or a soft stop.

The branches the user wrote a direction for, then those of the agents the user named, open first, from the start
commit the window names -- the root, or the Recipe KB champion PRELUDE replayed onto it -- and so does the opening
batch; the opening judge call sizes that batch into the slots those branches leave. Gains are still measured from the
root, which the window names apart.

The loop wakes every :data:`EXPLORE_TICK_SECONDS`: it hands the toolbox the quota again, which takes a stopped branch
out once the tests it was left to finish have ended, stops the repair branches that used up their time and the branches
whose specialist gave up, once no candidate of theirs waits for its confirm, moves the forks and repairs queued on the
fork desk onto the free slots, has the rule gate land each admitted fork and starts the admitted forks and repairs, and
every judge interval asks the judge, applies what it decided and rebuilds the dashboard. A slot the judge's stops free
goes to the queued requests first and only then to the branches the judge opens. The judge is asked at once, not at its
next interval, when the scheduler itself frees a slot: a repair branch stopped at its time limit, a branch whose
specialist gave up, a fork the gate did not land, or an admitted fork or repair that failed to start; and when an event
changes what the branches are worth: a merge that moved the integration head by a large gain, the bottleneck of the
profile taken of the integration head after such a merge moving, or a quarantined measurement node. A branch the
judge opens after the opening batch starts from the integration head, briefed on a focus. The judge reads the
frontier-scored progress, how similar archived sessions went, which running branches made much the same change, the
events since its last call, how far each branch lies behind the integration head, which branches lead it while their
commits fail to merge, whether a profile of the integration head runs, the GPU hours (tests' GPU time plus card
time any lease holds) and the LLM dollars the specialists and the scheduler itself spent so far, and what is known
of each running branch's specialist (given up, stopped because its judging failed, its heartbeat lost again and
again), which explore tests each branch has queued and which native builds its tests wait for, and decides
what to stop; a judge call that has not answered by the EXPLORE deadline counts as failed,
and a branch that has not opened by then is withdrawn, so neither eats into FINAL. The integrator merges in a background
task of its own, in rounds as wide as the integration branch's K. When EXPLORE ends that task is cancelled and the
integrator abandons its round, so the integration head the FINAL candidates are read from no longer moves and no merge
test competes with FINAL's measurements; a profile of the integration head still running is cancelled before that,
taking its test back. Under ``--max-gpu-hours`` EXPLORE also ends, at a tick, once the session's tests have used the GPU
hours FINAL's share leaves it, and under ``--max-llm-usd`` once the LLM spend recorded by the specialists, the judge
and the patch resolver reaches it: FINAL runs no specialist and asks no judge, so it gets no share of that cap. EXPLORE
ends at a tick as well once the toolbox has fewer usable cards than one test needs, and the session then skips FINAL.
