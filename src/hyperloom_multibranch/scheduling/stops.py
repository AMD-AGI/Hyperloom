"""Why a session stops, the operator's stop signals, and the two session-wide stops.

Ending exploration stops every specialist branch, withdraws the tests the branches stopped earlier were left to finish,
and keeps the integration branch for FINAL; a branch stop or a withdrawal that fails there is logged, not raised.
Stopping everything stops every branch including integration, which withdraws every test, then releases what the
session holds: it stops the MCP service the specialists reach their tools on, closes the toolbox, which releases the
sandboxes it holds, and kills every process the scheduler started, then reports what is still alive. The toolbox close
gets :data:`TOOLBOX_CLOSE_SECONDS`, or half the time left before the hard stop when that is less, the branch stops
the rest, and the release runs whether or not they finished. Both close the roster first, so no fork is admitted and
no branch opened afterwards, and void the forks and repairs still queued for a slot.
The main flow's signal drain lives in its loop package, which this package does not import.
