"""A person's review of the session's agent map, before the agent branches open (ArborDevelopment #30).

With the review on (the default; ``run --no-review-gate`` turns it off), a session with Arbor agents pauses once their
map is made: the dossier pass's, one generated from the root's shares, or the one ``--agent-directions`` gives. It
pauses before it splits the map and before any branch opens, holding no lease, and writes two files in its
``MB-review`` directory (:func:`request`): ``review.json``, the review's state (``pending``), and ``REVIEW.md``, what
the person reads: the map's directions, the dossier, and the commands. The person may edit the map file and the
dossier where they lie, then decides with ``hyperloom-multibranch review --session DIR approve|reject``
(:func:`decide`). That needs no running session: the file on the session's storage is the whole protocol, so a person
on a login node can decide for a session on a GPU node.

The session polls the file (:func:`wait`). Approved, it reads the map and the dossier again from disk, so the edits
are what its branches get, and ``review.json`` names every file the review changed; rejected, the session ends with
``review_rejected`` and opens nothing. The pause does not count against ``--max-hours``: EXPLORE ends that much later.

A session that stops after its map (``--stop-after-map``) does not pause: its stop is the review point, and its map is
reviewed offline, then given to a second run (``--agent-directions``, ``--agent-dossier``).
