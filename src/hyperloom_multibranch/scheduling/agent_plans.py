"""Each Arbor agent's share of the session's directions: a given map's split before EXPLORE, a made one's in it.

The user names one directions map with ``--agent-directions``: the open directions of an Arbor dossier map, or a list
written by hand, in the form Arbor's ``component.plan`` reads. Two Arbor agents given the whole map would work the
same directions. Split, each works its own. Before the agent branches open, each agent source is fetched once, and the
map is split by Arbor's own command line (:func:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.arbor_adapter.split_directions`)
into as many disjoint shares as there are Arbor agents, one each, in the order the user named them. Any other agent
gets none: only Arbor reads a plan.

Without a map, two or more Arbor agents split the map of the dossier pass (:mod:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.
dossier_pass`) a mapping branch runs in EXPLORE (:mod:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.map_session`), which the
session passes here as the map once the pass ends and opens a share branch for each share (operator, 2026-10-31: the
dossier pass is the default; 2026-11-02: it runs on a branch, so no other branch waits for it). When the pass gives none, they split one Arbor generates from the root's shares, PRELUDE's
profile, with no GPU time (:func:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.arbor_adapter.generate_directions`): one direction
per op family, ranked by its share. Those shares are the root's op shares, or its kernel shares when TraceLens gave none
(:mod:`~hyperloom_multibranch.scheduling.root_shares`), as ``shares_source`` says. A single Arbor gets none and maps its
own directions, which its dossier measures better.

A map that cannot be split, or generated, leaves every branch without a share, as without a map, and the log says why:
a source that cannot be fetched, no Arbor among the agents, fewer independent directions than Arbor agents, or a root
with no shares Arbor can use.

A session that stops after its map (``--stop-after-map``) maps for one Arbor too, splits nothing, and keeps the map and
the dossier beside it for a person to review (:func:`keep_map`); the run after the review is given them back.
