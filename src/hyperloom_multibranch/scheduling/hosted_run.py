"""What ``hyperloom-multibranch hosted run`` reads from the host and writes back to it.

The campaign spec maps onto the options of ``run`` (:func:`run_argv`), so a hosted session is built by the one builder
of :class:`~hyperloom_multibranch.scheduling.settings.RunSettings` a command-line session is. Besides the common part
the legacy entry validated, a multi-branch session needs ``multibranch.workload`` (``--workload``),
``workload.conc`` and ``workload.precision``; ``multibranch.max_branches`` is ``--max-branches`` and
``placement.max_parallel_tests`` is ``--max-parallel-tests``, at most what the grant runs at once. The fields ``run``
has no option for -- ``objective``, ``launch``, ``options``, ``placement.profile`` and
``placement.specialist_capacity`` -- are not read, and neither dev sandbox leases nor autonomous agents are given.
Every test, PRELUDE's included, runs in a measurement sandbox, as PRELUDE starts no child on a hosted session, so the
application's container needs no card: ``hosted-cpu`` serves as ``hosted-gpu`` does.

The grant bounds the session in time (:func:`grant_deadline`): its budget ends one CLOSE grace and a margin before the
grant does, and the process is sent SIGTERM one CLOSE grace before the grant ends, which ends FINAL and leaves CLOSE
that grace.

The host decides from ``$HYPERLOOM_STATE_DIR/exit.json`` whether to start the run again: never once it holds
``final: true`` (:func:`write_final_exit`), and again when it is missing. ``session.json`` there names the session
directory as soon as it exists (:func:`record_session`), so a start that finds it finishes that session instead of
starting another. The two file names and their fields are the legacy entry's, ``hyperloom.hosted.entry``, which this
package does not import: importing it loads the legacy flow's state.
