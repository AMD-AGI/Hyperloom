"""The peers a session runs on and what they are built on.

A :data:`PeerFactory` builds the specialist lifecycle, the toolbox, the experiment repository, the rule gate's
session service, the session's MCP service and its briefs on a :class:`PeerSetup`: the session directory, the workload the session optimizes, the scheduler's
answer to the rule gate's branch requests, the session's process registry, its blob store, the critic that
reviews a declared correctness fix and the reference material the run was given. The specialist runtime builds its own rule gates on the branch requests; the
session gate judges the tests the scheduler submits itself.

    ``workload`` is the measurement surface: the toolbox measures every test and sweep of the session on it, so a
    test request carries no operating point of its own. ``desk`` is what the specialist runtime builds its rule gates
    on. ``processes`` is the session's process registry: the session stop kills what is registered there even when a
    peer's own stop hangs, and reports what outlives that kill; the specialist runtime registers every process the AI
    work socket starts for it with ``processes.adopt``. The toolbox's sandboxes are its own: the session stop releases
    them by closing the toolbox. ``blobs`` holds the patch and kernel files the recipes name; the toolbox's
    environment compiler reads them from it. ``critic`` decides whether the defect a proven correctness fix removes is
    reachable under the workload. ``references`` names each directory of reference material the run was given, already
    copied into the session, for the specialist role to send the specialists to. ``dev_leases`` is how many dev
    sandboxes the session lends its specialists at once, from the toolbox's cards; 0 lends none. ``agents`` are the
    third-party agents the user named, each run on an autonomous branch of its own, ``reference_script`` the operator's
    launch file the session freezes as its base (``""`` for none), ``agent_pack`` the pack an
    Arbor among them runs (``""`` for the adapter's default), ``agent_launch`` the file of the launch its recipe's
    adds to (``""`` when the recipe's is the whole launch), ``agent_port`` the first port of their port blocks,
    ``agent_dossier`` the dossier the run gives every agent branch with its reviewed map (``""`` for none), and
    ``agent_review`` how an Arbor's own review gate is handed over (``AgentSpec.review``: the host reviews, nobody
    does, or ``""`` for neither), ``agent_maps`` the scheduler's side of a mapping branch, ``None`` without agents, and
    ``agent_share_minutes`` the least an agent must have left to run for its branch to wait for cards its lease was
    refused. ``inferencex_commit`` is the commit a fresh session's base launch reads InferenceX at (``""`` for the
    head of its ``main``). ``agentx_early_stop`` is the session's AgentX checkpoint mode (``RunSettings``).
