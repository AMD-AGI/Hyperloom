"""The peers a session runs on and what they are built on.

A :data:`PeerFactory` builds the specialist lifecycle, the toolbox, the experiment repository, the rule gate's
session service, the session's MCP service and its briefs on a :class:`PeerSetup`: the session directory, the workload the session optimizes, the scheduler's
answer to the rule gate's branch requests, the session's process registry, its blob store, the critic that
reviews a declared correctness fix and the reference material the run was given. The specialist runtime builds its own rule gates on the branch requests; the
session gate judges the tests the scheduler submits itself.

    work socket starts for it with ``processes.adopt``. The toolbox's sandboxes are its own: the session stop releases
    them by closing the toolbox. ``blobs`` holds the patch and kernel files the recipes name; the toolbox's
    environment compiler reads them from it. ``critic`` decides whether the defect a proven correctness fix removes is
    reachable under the workload. ``references`` names each directory of reference material the run was given, already
