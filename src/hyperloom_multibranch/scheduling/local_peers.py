"""The real peers of a session on one machine: the git experiment repository, the toolbox, the rule gate's session
service, the specialist runtime on them and the MCP service that serves the specialists their tools.

:func:`local_peers` builds them inside the session directory: the repository at ``MB-repo``, the toolbox's
sandboxes, archive, submit log and measurement points under ``MB-toolbox``, and the patch and kernel files its
environment compiler reads, like the repository, from the session's blob store at ``MB-blobs``. The MCP service listens on loopback for the whole session and hands every toolbox call to the loop the peers were built
on; its learnings tool recalls this session's learnings and past sessions' lessons from the RSI lesson pool, and none
from the Experience KB, as MB1 runs on none (:func:`specialist_recall`). Every test is measured on a
:class:`MeasurementHost`: the :class:`ToolboxBackend` its tests run on -- this machine's cards
(:class:`LocalCards`), or the host's sandbox service for a hosted session
(:class:`~hyperloom_multibranch.scheduling.hosted_peers.HostedSandboxes`) --, the image the launcher names in
``HYPERLOOM_ACTIVE_IMAGE_REF`` and ``HYPERLOOM_ACTIVE_IMAGE_DIGEST``, the Magpie commit Hyperloom pins and an
InferenceX checkout at the commit the workload's benchmark pins (:class:`InferenceXCheckout`); the canonical
measurement is rendered with the workload's model and GPU type and that checkout, from the shipped baseline of an InferenceX workload and from the Magpie AgentX benchmark
the session writes for an AgentX one, which the PRELUDE child is bound to as well. The gate's session service and the
specialist runtime judge on one rule, :func:`workload_rule`; the runtime settles through a rule gate that asks the
scheduler's fork desk for branches, and the MCP service's ``request_repair`` and ``decline_repair`` conclude a blocked
candidate through the same gate, which the scheduler has land each fork it admits and record each fork and repair it
voids. A specialist declares a correctness fix with the MCP service's ``fix_case``; the runtime proves it with the repro
runner the regression set uses and has the setup's critic review it. The runtime's specialist sessions come from a
:data:`SpecialistSessions`: :func:`model_backed_sessions` runs each branch's specialist as an agent CLI in a worktree of
its own, briefed by the session's :class:`SessionBriefs`, whose warm-start leads the session binds once PRELUDE has read
them and which reads the repository for a replay's branch head. :func:`load_peers` reads the measurement host, checks
the image holds the framework package those worktrees branch off and resolves that CLI first, and refuses when either
cannot be had, so the command line fails before it creates anything.

On either backend a test of an AgentX workload may run for its trace window and the boot and warmup around it
(:func:`attempt_timeout_sec`).

The toolbox, its measurement points and the agent sessions load the main flow's runtime, so they are imported inside
the functions that use them: importing this module, the command line or the session loads none of it.
