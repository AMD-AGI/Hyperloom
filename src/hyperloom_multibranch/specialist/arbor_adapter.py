"""Arbor as an autonomous branch's agent, made ready without the onboarding model: the Arbor lifecycle adapter.

Arbor runs inside a host in its component mode, whose contract is its ``docs/hosts.md``: one config, a snapshot of each
kept change in its session's outbox, an exit file written before every exit 0, and exit 2 for a config it refuses,
which a host never starts again. A checkout that has that mode, its entry point and that contract is Arbor's
(:func:`is_arbor`), and the preflight (:mod:`agent_onboarding`) takes its manifest from here instead of asking the
model: the config follows from the branch's spec alone (:func:`arbor_config`), on Arbor's serving template pack, with
the gate's client as its bench command (:func:`bench_command`) and its session in its checkout, the directory the
manifest's snapshots name. Before Arbor starts, the config is checked against what Arbor refuses at its start
(:func:`refusals`): Arbor's ``--dry-run`` runs its loop on synthetic numbers and checks none of it. Another attempt
would write the same config, so a refusal, this side's or Arbor's own, fails the preflight at once.

The spec's ``plan``, the file of the branch's share of the session's directions, becomes ``component.plan``. Those
shares come from one map, which Arbor's dossier pass writes on one lease before the branches open
(:data:`DOSSIER_PASS`, its end read by :func:`mapped`) or Arbor generates from the root's profile with no GPU time
(:func:`generate_directions`), split by Arbor's own command line (:func:`split_directions`); the scheduling calls these.
The dossier the pass wrote (:func:`pass_dossier`) is copied into each branch's checkout (:func:`carry_dossier`), where
Arbor looks a dossier up. The root's op shares are not the adapter's: the preflight sets
``component.profile`` for Arbor as for any agent run as a component
(:func:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.agent_onboarding.component_config`).

The spec's ``launch``, a launch file (:func:`read_launch`), stands in for what MB does not carry yet: the launch a
Magpie AgentX recipe resolves from InferenceX, of which the root recipe holds only what is added to it. Without one,
an AgentX branch is refused before Arbor starts, which would otherwise serve defaults MB does not measure.

The spec's ``review`` hands Arbor's human review gate over (ArborDevelopment #30): Arbor waits at the start of a new
session for a person's approval unless the host says it reviewed (``component.review: "host"``, :data:`REVIEW_HOST`)
or the config turns the gate off (``"review_gate": false``, :data:`REVIEW_OFF`). Arbor refuses a component key it does
not know, so either is written only for a checkout whose component mode has the gate (:func:`has_review_gate`); an
older Arbor gets neither and runs as before. The keys a checkout declares (:func:`declared_keys`) decide the others
too: a key that changes what Arbor runs, which the pinned Arbor lacks, refuses its start, naming the Arbor commit to
pin (:data:`KEY_SINCE`); an input it can run without (:data:`OPTIONAL_KEYS`) is left out with a note (:func:`fit_keys`).
