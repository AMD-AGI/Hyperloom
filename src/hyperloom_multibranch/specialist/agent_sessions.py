"""The autonomous branches of a session: what each one's run is built from.

Every agent's branch gets ports of its own: the branch first built takes the first port block, the next the following
one, and a branch keeps its block for the session, a restart included. Its sandbox runs on the cards its preflight
leases from the toolbox: on this host (:class:`LocalAgentSandboxes`), in the lease's directory with the lease's
environment on top of the session's, or, on the hosted backend, in the leased ``dev`` sandbox
(:class:`RemoteAgentSandboxes`), rooted in the branch's session directory. Its onboarding model is the specialists' CLI
(:mod:`agent_onboard`) with its spend recorded in the branch's blackboard, where the agent's own spend goes too, read
from the transcripts of the Claude CLI's directory the sandbox gives the agent (:mod:`agent_spend`). Given the gate's
benchmark client (:mod:`gate_client`), each agent's spec names it aimed at the branch's first port.

The dossier pass (:mod:`dossier_pass`) runs on the same: in EXPLORE as the run of a mapping branch (:mod:`map_session`),
in the branch's place on its port block, its lease charged to it; in a session that stops after its map, with a port
block, a worktree and a directory beside the branches', under :data:`~.dossier_pass.DOSSIER_HOLDER`. The dossier it
writes is given to every agent branch built after it, which copies it into its checkout; a run given a reviewed map and
its dossier runs no pass, and gives every branch that dossier.
