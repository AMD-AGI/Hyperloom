"""What an autonomous branch submits for each change its agent keeps.

The agent edits a workspace of its own, a checkout of the session's source base at the root, and keeps the server
arguments and environment it runs with in a file the manifest names. A keep is read as a :class:`KeptChange`: the
workspace's patch against the root and the agent's whole config, both cumulative. :func:`import_delta` turns it into
the delta against the branch head, which holds only what MB committed. Its source goes in as one more patch on the
head's, the increment from the state the head's imports make to the keep's, so a commit carries only its own change to
a merge; a keep the gate rejected is not on the head and comes back inside the next increment. A kernel table the agent
loads from files of its own goes in as a kernel artifact, the text the files held at the keep: an aiter variable's
value may list the image's default tables before them, which the artifact's rows are read over at a test as they were
in the agent's run, so it carries only the agent's rows.

An agent run as a component writes each keep whole instead, as a snapshot directory (:func:`read_snapshot`, the layout
of Arbor's component mode): ``keep.json`` names the keep before it and the commits it was made on and made, its
``change.patch`` takes the one to the other, ``config.json`` is its whole launch, of which only what differs from the
launch it was started with goes in, and ``tables/<VAR>/`` the kernel table each variable loads, with the digest ``keep.json`` lists (a table too large to copy is listed with no file). Its source
is the chain of its patches from the root, so a snapshot made on a commit that no snapshot of the chain made, or on a
root other than the one MB gave, is refused; one made on the root after another, its ``notes`` saying the earlier commit
is gone, starts the chain again with ``served.patch``, its whole tree against the root. What the agent's tree links to
outside itself (``outside.json``) is not read: AITER builds a JIT module it lacks at its first call.
