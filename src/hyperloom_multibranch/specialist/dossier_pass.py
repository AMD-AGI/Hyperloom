"""The session's dossier pass: Arbor run once to map the directions the agent branches split.

With two or more Arbor agents and no map given, the session runs the first Arbor source once as its dossier pass
(:data:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.arbor_adapter.DOSSIER_PASS`, ``component.stop_at: "map"``), as Arbor's
``docs/hosts.md`` describes it:
- **where:** on a worktree at the commit the branches open on, with that commit's launch, on the cards of one lease;
- **with what:** the root's shares as its ``component.profile``, until its deadline;
- **what it leaves:** the dossier and its map, then exit 0 with ``mapped``. The map is what the session splits
  (:mod:`~hyperloom_multibranch.scheduling.agent_plans`), and the dossier is copied into each branch's checkout.

In EXPLORE a mapping branch (:mod:`map_session`) holds the pass, and its lease is charged to that branch; a session that
stops after its map runs it before EXPLORE, held by no branch and charged to the integration branch. It writes nothing to the blackboard. Whatever ends it, its process is killed and its cards are given back. A pass that sets no map says
why (:class:`DossierOutcome`), and the session falls back to the generic map.
