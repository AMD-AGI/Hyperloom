"""Making an autonomous branch's agent ready to run: its preflight.

The agent's source is fetched once into the branch's directory. Each attempt then asks the onboarding model, which
reads that checkout, for the manifest (:mod:`agent_manifest`), writes the agent's config from it, runs its install
commands in the branch's sandbox and starts it. An attempt fails with one line that says which step failed and what
the step printed last, and the next attempt's prompt carries every earlier line, so the model corrects the manifest
instead of repeating it; it starts :data:`RETRY_SECONDS` after the failure, so a gateway that failed for a moment does
not take every attempt with it. After :data:`ATTEMPTS` failures the preflight raises
:class:`~hyperloom_multibranch.specialist.runtime.PreflightFailed` with every line.

An agent that writes a snapshot of each keep runs as a component of MB, in the mode Arbor's README describes: MB sets
that mode, its host, the absolute deadline and the commit its keeps are read against in its config itself
(:func:`component_config`), whatever the manifest says of them.

The agent runs commands, not containers: a ``docker`` on its ``PATH`` (:data:`DOCKER_SHIM`) runs ``docker exec`` and
``docker cp`` in place, for an agent written to drive a container, and refuses everything else.

ONBOARDING_PROMPT = """\
You are onboarding a third-party LLM-serving optimization agent so it can run unattended in a sandbox. Your working
directory is the agent's checkout, {checkout}, a clone of {source} at {commit}. Read its README, its docs and its entry
points before you answer. Every file the agent writes (its config, the packs or scripts the install adds, its session
and run directories) must be in that checkout or in "workspace", never in {source}: give absolute paths under them.

It will optimize this workload, and every value its config needs must come from here, not be invented. "server_args" and
"envs" are what the recipe the branch starts on adds to a server of "model" at "tp"; the agent's own model, host, port
and TP flags come on top of them:
{spec}

The sandbox:
- has the session's image and framework and no docker daemon. It sees only the GPUs in "cards", numbered from 0
  (ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES holds them): a GPU id the agent's config gives is one of those, 0 the first; never set
  ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES, HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES or CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in a command of your own: a command whose
  ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES reaches other cards is killed. A `docker` on PATH runs `docker exec [-w DIR] [-e K=V]
  CONTAINER CMD...` as CMD in DIR and `docker cp C:SRC DST` as a copy, so an agent written to drive a container works
  when its config names any container;
- shares the host with other servers: `pkill`, `pgrep` and `killall` reach only the agent's own processes, but turn
  off any other sweep that kills what holds GPU memory, and give the agent's servers a port no one else uses;
- the agent edits the framework source in "workspace", in place, and launches its servers from it;
- "seconds" is how long the agent may run, 0 when MB stops it: then give it a time budget it cannot reach.

If the agent can run inside a host (Arbor's component mode, which its docs/hosts.md describes: an absolute deadline, the
commit its patches are made against, and a snapshot directory written for each kept change), run it in that mode: MB
sets its "mode", "docker_container", "component.deadline" ("deadline") and "component.root" ("root") itself; set
everything else docs/hosts.md asks of a host, give its session a directory in the checkout, and answer "snapshots".

MB judges every change the agent keeps by measuring it with "client", the gate's own benchmark client, against a
server on "port"; another client sends other prompts and ranks changes otherwise. Unless "client" is empty, make the
agent measure every A/B, its baseline included, with exactly that command, changing only the port of --base-url to the
server it measures and --result-dir to a directory of its own: no other client, dataset, prompt count or warmup, even
when the agent ships a benchmark of its own. "baseline" is what the gate measured of "metric" on the session's root
with it, which the agent's own measurement of that recipe should come close to.

"knowledge" is a markdown file MB rewrites whenever the session's integration branch takes a change from another
branch: its server arguments, environment, patches and the changes merged into it. Make the agent read it at the start
of every iteration, through its goal, notes or instructions, and never redo a change it lists.

Answer with one JSON object and nothing else, with exactly these fields:
- "source": "{source}", "commit": "{commit}";
- "install": shell commands run once in the checkout, [] when none;
- "config_file": where the agent's config goes, relative to the checkout; "config": that config, as an object;
- "launch": the shell command that runs the agent end to end from the checkout; "resume": the one that continues a
  run after a crash, "" when launching again does;
- "keep": how a kept change shows, {{"path": file relative to the checkout, "field": dotted path of the counter (a
  number or a list) as the file has it once the first keep is in, or "" when every change of the file is a keep,
  "where": {{field: value}} that a list item must match}}, or null when the agent keeps nothing and only the state its
  workspace ends in counts;
- "config_source": where the agent keeps the server arguments and environment of what it kept, {{"path": a JSON file,
  "root": "workspace" when the path is relative to "workspace", "checkout" when relative to the checkout, "server_args":
  the dotted field of the arguments string, "envs": the dotted field of the environment, an object or one string of
  NAME=VALUE words, "adds": true when the two hold only what the agent accepted on top of the "server_args" and "envs"
  it was started with, false when they are its whole config}}. A tuned kernel table the agent deploys through an
  environment variable (an AITER_CONFIG_* path) is a change it keeps: when its result file reports the accepted
  environment (for example accepted_config.env beside accepted_config.flags), name that file here. null only when the
  agent keeps neither arguments nor environment of its own;
- "summary_field": dotted path in the keep file to the agent's own words for its latest keep (an integer step indexes
  a list, -1 its last item), "" when none;
- "needs": what it requires, from "anthropic", "openai", "network", "docker";
- "ledger": where the agent writes down what it found, {{"path": JSON-lines file relative to the checkout, "id": the
  field of an entry's id, "kind": the field of its kind, "text": the field of the finding, "kinds": {{each of the
  agent's kinds that states a measured fact or a dead end: "insight" or "pitfall"}}}}, or null when it writes none;
- "snapshots": for an agent run in that mode, {{"session": its session directory relative to the checkout, where it
  writes its snapshot outbox and its exit file}}, with "keep" and "config_source" null; null otherwise.
