"""A branch driven by a third-party agent that optimizes end to end by its own logic: an autonomous branch.

The preflight leases the branch's sandbox, its own cards, from the toolbox, makes the agent ready in it
(:mod:`agent_onboarding`) and keeps the lease and the manifest in the branch's session directory, so a run after a crash
resumes the agent in the same sandbox without onboarding again, and records the manifest in the blackboard for CLOSE's
archive; the lease goes back when the branch stops. A run then
watches the agent's keep signal and reads each keep whole (:mod:`agent_import`) the moment it shows, since the agent
goes on to its next candidate in the same workspace. Keeps are submitted as claimless explore tests against the branch
head, one at a time: a keep that lands while an import is measured or judged waits, and a later keep replaces it, since
each is cumulative. An agent that signals no keep has its workspace taken as its keep once, early enough before EXPLORE
ends for the session's queued tests and then its own to be measured and judged in EXPLORE (:func:`collection_margin`),
and again when it exits 0. What the run knows of the keeps is kept beside the manifest, so a keep waiting at a crash is
submitted by the run after it. The agent's own LLM spend is read from its Claude CLI's transcripts (:mod:`agent_spend`)
every :data:`SPEND_SECONDS` and once more when the run ends, and recorded as the branch's. At each keep, the findings
the agent wrote down in its ledger since the last one become the branch's learnings, a finding it revised superseding
what it said before, so other branches read them; what it wrote after its last keep is learnt when the branch stops. The
branch's judge judges the imports as it judges any branch's tests; nothing of its verdicts reaches the agent, but
what the integration head holds does, through the notes (:mod:`agent_knowledge`) rewritten whenever the head moves,
and the agent is given until its last import can still be judged in EXPLORE as its time budget. An agent that writes
a snapshot of each keep (Arbor's component mode) runs to that time as its absolute deadline, against the commit its
workspace starts on, and has its newest snapshot read whole, chained back to that commit (:func:`read_snapshot`); why it
ended, from its exit file, goes into the branch log. An agent
that exits 0 finishes the run once what it kept last settled; one that exits otherwise is a crash the runtime restarts
it from. A session never ends idle: what the agent keeps, or does not, is its own business, bounded by the session's
stops. A watch beside the run's poll makes the run a lost session when the running agent writes nothing (no output,
transcript or file), or the poll does not come round, for :data:`STALL_SECONDS`: the runtime then kills the agent and resumes it, and gives the branch
up after a few such losses in a row, so a hung agent does not hold its cards and its branch's slot.
