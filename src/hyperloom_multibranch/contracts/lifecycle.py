    specialist (the warm-start leads for the first batch, the cross-session brief for a fill); the runtime puts it into
    the specialist's first prompt and every restart prompt. Its ``repair`` is the request an admitted repair branch was
    opened for, started at its intent's parent commit; every prompt of the branch's specialist shows it as the
    branch's task, whatever brief a launch is rebuilt with. Its ``direction`` is the text a user wrote for the branch;
    every launch and restart prompt shows it as the branch's task, the way ``repair`` is shown. Its ``agent`` names the
    third-party agent an autonomous branch runs, a git URL (``URL@ref`` for a ref) or a local path, and is empty for a
    specialist branch. Its ``deadline`` is the clock time (``time.time``) EXPLORE ends at, 0 when the branch has none:
    an agent that signals no keep has its workspace collected ahead of it. A started branch may
    have one test running until ``set_k`` says otherwise, and shrinking a branch to nothing is ``stop``, not
    ``set_k(branch, 0)``. Every process the runtime starts goes through the session's process registry, so the session
    stop kills it even when ``stop`` hangs.
